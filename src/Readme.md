Sample code for C# patterns (and records)

This entire solution is sample code and there is no claim about its value beyond learning about C# features.  

This is a working directory, so the branches are a little messy. Look for a branch that "start" to practice fixing the code.

* Patterns

The TollCalculator.cs is reversed to non-pattern programming from the code in Microsoft docs:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-Us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/pattern-matching. You can 
read more about the problem we're solving there, or you can just dive in to fixing the code. 

I recommend you work from the bottom up. The hardest method to fix is the first one.


* Records

The ExteranalSystems project is set up to demo records, and I rarely use. Thanks to Fred Silberberg for this code.
