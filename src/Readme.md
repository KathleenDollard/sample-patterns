Sample code for C# patterns 

This entire solution is sample code and there is no claim about its value beyond learning about C# features.  

This is a working directory, so the branches are a little messy. Look for a branch that "start" and the workshop you attended to practice fixing the code.

* Patterns

The TollCalculator.cs is reversed to non-pattern programming from the code in Microsoft docs:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-Us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/pattern-matching. You can 
read more about the problem we're solving there, or you can just dive in to fixing the code. 

I recommend you work from the bottom up. The hardest method to fix is the first one.

The rest of this solution has fallen out of use as it was to demo features from previous versions of C#.
